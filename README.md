I have an academic background in physics and I am progressively re-engaging with the discipline
through scientific programming and numerical computation.

My work focuses on building a solid computational foundation for physics, with particular interest in:
- quantum mechanics,
- numerical methods,
- and quantum computing.

This GitHub profile documents a structured and continuous learning path, starting from Python fundamentals
and advancing toward numerical physics and quantum-oriented applications.
The repositories reflect an emphasis on conceptual clarity, mathematical consistency, and physical interpretation.

## Learning Path

- Python fundamentals
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Numerical computing (NumPy)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib)
- Numerical explorations in quantum mechanics
- Scientific computing and quantum applications

## Notes

This GitHub is intended as a technical and academic learning record,
rather than a collection of finalized software projects.
